# AMLReadingGroup
This repository is a living knowledge base to collect notes, learnings, and best practices for the AML Reading Group and broader community.

## Goals
1. Determine/communicate the largest bottlenecks in applied machine learning
1. Build working relationships between industry + academia to erode those bottlenecks over time.
1. Build knowledge base of open-source resources/best-practices for addressing bottlenecks in applied machine learning.
